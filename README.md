# ☀️ Solar Power Generation Analysis

This project explores solar power generation data to evaluate inverter performance, analyze environmental impacts, and visualize system efficiency. Python is used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis, while Tableau provides interactive dashboards to communicate insights.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze power generation trends over time
- Assess the relationship between solar irradiation, temperature, and power output
- Evaluate the efficiency of two solar inverters (`SOURCE_KEY`)
- Visualize insights using interactive charts and dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for data processing and EDA)
- **Tableau**: For interactive dashboard creation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis
- **CSV Dataset**: Solar generation and weather sensor data

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- A strong positive correlation exists between **irradiation** and **DC power output**
- **Temperature** slightly affects efficiency — high temperatures can reduce output
- One inverter consistently underperforms compared to the other
- Efficiency varies by time of day and environmental conditions

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Integrate more inverters or longer time periods
- Perform fault detection or alert generation based on performance
- Add predictive modeling to estimate future output
